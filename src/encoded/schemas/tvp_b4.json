This form is to be completed by the clinician or other trained health professional, basedon co-participant report and behavioral and neurological exam of the subject. In the extremely rare instances whenno co-participant is available, the clinician or other trained health professional must complete this form using allother available information and his/her best clinical judgement. Score only as decline from previous level due tocognitive loss, not impairment due to other factors, such as physical disability.
